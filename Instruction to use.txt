If you are using tapped frame (boundary) with color other than white,
then use the folder named (Frame with Tapped BG)
---
If you are using tapped frame with white background OR 
White bg with distinguishing wall color,
than feel free to use folder named (Frame with White BG).

If you are not using a Webcam than there is also a video name (Tennis_ball_wall_12.mp4) is attached with the python code in the code you can edit it to work properly.

     |cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)			       |

to   |# Initialize video capture ('link' for default camera)|
     |cap = cv2.VideoCapture("Tennis_ball_wall_12.mp4")     |
